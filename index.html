        <h1>Complete Vocal Technique</h1>
            <p>Пение не такое сложное как всем кажеться и каждый может научиться. Я разделил елементы исользуемые при пение на 4 основных группы как показано ниже. Соеденяя елемнты каждых из этих четырех инструментов, вы можете добиться именно того звучания, которого вы хотите. Вы так же сможете определить проблемы и ошибки, и выбать, на какие техники вы хочете уделить больше времени.</p>
            <h3>Четыре основных инструмента:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Три общих принципа – обеспечит здоровое звуко-извлечение.</li>
                    <li>Четеыре вокальных режима – помогут выбрать ‘настройку’ в которой вы хотите петь.</li>
                    <li>Звуковые окраски – помогут дать характрность вашему звуку.</li>
                    <li>Эффкты – помогут достичь определенного звукового эффекта.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Три Общих Принципа</h2>
                <p>Этих три общих принципа — основа основ, и важно их постоянно совершенствовать. Именно они позволяют нам достичь всех тех высоких и низких нот в диопазоне каждого индивидуома, петь долгие фразы, иметь чистый и сильный голос и избежать хрипоты в голосе.</p>
                <p>Эти три общих принципа должны быть соблюдены в независимости от вокальной техники, окраса или эффекта, и это:</p>

                <h3>1. Диофрагмовая поддержка</h3>
                    <p>Это значить работать против натурального желания диофрагмы выпустить воздух. Оно достигаеться сопротивлением: Во время пения, During singing, the waist muscles and solar plexus are pushed outwards whilst the abdomen around the navel is gradually pulled in, in a constant and sustained manner, and the back muscles are tightened. The muscles in the loin try to pull the pelvis backwards, while the muscles in the abdomen try to pull the pelvis up under your body.</p>
                    <p>This battle created between the abdominal muscles and the muscles in the loin is a valuable and important part of support. However, the support must happen in a sustained and continuous manner as though working against a resistance for as long as a sound is being produced. When the muscle contractions stop being sustained and continuous, for instance if you cannot pull the abdomen around the navel inwards any further or push the muscles of the waist or solar plexus outwards any further, then there is usually no more support.</p>
                    <p>It is important to conserve your support energy so you do not waste it or use it at the wrong point in time. Do not use support energy before it is necessary. Save it for when the singing gets difficult, such as on high notes or at the end of a phrase. Support work is hard physical work so you should be in good physical condition.</p>

                <h3>2. Necessary Twang</h3>
                    <p>The area above the vocal cords forms a funnel; this is called the ‘epiglottic funnel’. When twanging, the epiglottic funnel is narrowed. The narrowing of the epiglottic funnel can be performed in various ways from the lowest part of the funnel to the rim of the funnel. As a result, the sound gets clearer and non-breathy, and you can increase your volume. You always need to use necessary twang, especially on metallic modes, in order to have correct technique and achieve easy and unhindered use of the voice regardless of the sound colour and effect used. Necessary twang makes it easier to sing in all ways. For many, this necessary twang does not sound twanged at all.</p>

                <h3>3. Avoid protruding the jaw and tightening the lips</h3>
                    <p>Avoid protruding the jaw and tightening the lips, as it might trigger uncontrolled constriction, especially in the high part of the voice. Achieve a correct jaw position by bending your head back and placing a finger between the upper and lower jaw. Keep this position of the jaw as you sing. The lower jaw should be pulled backwards relative to the upper jaw. Be sure to open the mouth wider on high and low notes than on notes in the middle part of the voice.</p>
                    <p>Whilst avoiding tightening the lips, it is also important to form vowels with the tongue without altering the shape of the mouth too much. Consonants on the other hand are usually produced by narrowing the vocal tract and by tension in the lips, but as you do not stay on them for very long in singing, they do not impair singing. It is important to be able to release the tension immediately going from consonants to vowels.</p>

            <h2>The four vocal modes</h2>
                <p>There are two levels when working with the modes: the foundation level looking at the modes and the metal; and the advanced level, looking at the density of the modes. You can easily use the vocal modes without getting into their densities. When nothing is stated about the density, it is implied that the density is fuller.</p>

            <h1>The foundation level: Metal</h1>
                <p>The use of the voice can be divided into four vocal modes: Neutral, Curbing, Overdrive and Edge. The modes differ by having different amounts of metal and different characters. The modes also have individual advantages and disadvantages in relation to pitch, volume, vowels and sound colours. Most singing problems occur because of incorrect use of the modes. Each mode has a certain character, as well as advantages and limitations. It is important to know and control the modes to benefit from the advantages and to avoid the limitations. It is also important to be able to change freely between the modes in order to make the most of their advantages when singing and avoid their limitations. You can change smoothly, or make abrupt changes to achieve vocal breaks. Each of the four vocal modes should be trained individually and in different ways. Remember to obey the three overall principles regardless of the mode.</p>

                <h2 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 27.667px; line-height: 49.406px;" data-fontsize="28" data-lineheight="50">Neutral</h2>
                    <h3>Definition for Neutral (foundation level)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Neutral is the non-metallic mode, containing 0% of metal.</li>
                        <li>The character of Neutral is clear, open, soft and non-metallic.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Neutral is a very extensive mode that contains many different sounds and sound colours. The sounds are softer and milder than the metallic modes. When starting out, Neutral can be found by establishing a loose jaw.</p>
                    <p>The Neutral mode has through time also been called classical, but this is misleading, as classical singing just as often uses the metallic modes. Neutral is also used when singing popular music. Therefore, I have chosen the name Neutral to describe the mode, because I felt the mode needed a more unbiased, neutral term.</p>

                    <h3>Neutral</h3>
                        <p>Female — Neutral</p>
                            <audio controls autoplay="true" src="https://completevocalinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/soundlibrary/CVT%20F%20056.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
                        <p>Male — Neutral</p>
                            <audio controls autoplay="true" src="https://completevocalinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/soundlibrary/CVT%20M%20056.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>

                    <p>All parts of the voice, all vowels, and all sound colours can be used in Neutral by both men and women.</p>
                    <p>Neutral is limited by volume. In general, it is a quiet mode, from volume 1- 4 out of 10, From very quiet (‘pp’ or ‘pianissimo’) to medium quiet (‘mp’ or ‘mezzo piano’), but there are exceptions. It is possible to obtain greater volumes in Neutral than in Neutral with audible air. Very loud volumes, volumes 7-10 out of 10 (‘ff’ or ‘fortissimo’), can be obtained in Neutral in the high part of the voice (from C5 upwards for women and C4 upwards for men). Medium volume, 4-7 out of 10 (medium quiet to medium loud) is also possible in Neutral when more twang is added to the sound.</p>
                    <p>In the western world, Neutral is normally the mode in which women start getting singing tuition. This is most likely because many people have been brought up truely believing that the soft and mild character of Neutral is the most healthy, and therefore best suited.</p>
                    <p>The Neutral mode is the only mode where you as an effect can add audible air. You can add different amounts of audible air, from very little to a great deal, meaning that you can sing in Neutral with all amounts of audible air, from notes without any audible air at all to notes that are soft and breathy. In general we talk about ‘Neutral’, but if audible air is added to the mode as an effect, it is called ‘Neutral with audible air’. For clarity, ‘Neutral and ‘Neutral with audible air’ are sometimes shown separately, as they have different rules and possibilities.</p>

                    <h3>Neutral with audible air</h3>
                        <p>Female — Neutral</p>
                            <audio controls autoplay="true" src="https://completevocalinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/soundlibrary/CVT%20F%20055.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
                        <p>Male — Neutral</p>

                    <p>Both classical male and female singers use Neutral without any audible air when singing quietly (pp-mp) in their entire range, for example in connection with thinning (decrescendo) and singing in pianissimo. Women use Neutral without any audible air in classical singing in all volumes in the high part of their voice. Men use Neutral without any audible air in classical singing when singing medium to loud (mf-ff) volume with a non-metallic character in the high part of their voice.</p>
                    <p>In everyday life, Neutral is used when you speak or sing quietly.</p>

                <h2>Curbing</h2>

                    <h3>Definition for Curbing (foundation level)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Curbing is reduced metallic, containing various amounts of metal, from a minimal amount, like 1%, all the way to around 50% metal</li>
                        <li>The character of Curbing is restrained, lidded and held back.</li>
                        <li>It can be found by establishing a light ‘hold’.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The character of Curbing is restrained. The sound could be described as slightly plaintive, lidded, held-back, or restrained.</p>
                    <p>Curbing can be found by establishing a light ‘hold’. Curbing contains various amounts of metal, from a minimal amount, like 1%, up to around 50% metal.</p>
                    <p>You cannot add audible air to the voice in Curbing; even attempting it may result in straining the voice.</p>
                    <p>To ‘Curb’ means to ‘hold’, to ‘tame’, to keep ‘under control. I have chosen the name ‘Curbing’ because it, in my opinion, describes what it might feel like to sing while holding back the sound and thereby giving it its restrained character and preventing it (or ‘curbing’ it) from becoming fuller metallic.</p>
                    <p>Men can use Curbing in all pitches, but in the low and very low part of the voice the sound becomes more and more restrained.</p>
                    <p>Women can use Curbing through all the various parts of the voice, up to the High C but again, in the low and very low part of the voice the sound becomes more and more restrained. Women cannot sing in Curbing in the very high part of the voice.</p>
                    <p>Curbing is used for artistic reasons when a singer wants to sing with a slightly plaintive, lidded, held-back and restrained character. Like when a singer sings the vowels ‘O’ (as in ‘woman’) and OO’ (as in ‘you’) in a relatively loud volume with some amount of metal.</p>
                    <p>In Curbing, you can use the vowel ‘UH’ (as in ‘hungry’). The ‘UH’ encompasses many vowel nuances as many vowels can have an ‘UH’ sound. Also, the vowels ‘O’ (as in ‘woman’) and ‘OO’ (as in ‘you’) can be used in Curbing when sung with a relatively loud volume.</p>

                    <p>Female — Curbing</p>
                        <audio controls autoplay="true" src="https://completevocalinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/soundlibrary/CVT%20F%20072.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
                    <p>Male — Curbing</p>
                        <audio controls autoplay="true" src="https://completevocalinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/soundlibrary/CVT%20M%20072.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>

                    <p>Curbing largely stays in the medium volume range, from medium quiet (‘mp’ or ‘mezzo piano’) to medium loud (‘mf’ or ‘mezzo forte’). From volume 4 -7 out of 10. Very quiet (‘pp’ or ‘pianissimo’) and very loud (‘ff’ or ‘fortissimo’) volumes are not attainable in Curbing.</p>
                    <p>The sound colour can be altered extensively within Curbing.</p>
                    <p>Curbing is used in many styles of popular music (such as R & B music) when the volume is medium loud and a certain amount of restrained metal is required.</p>
                    <p>Curbing is used in classical music when singing medium loud volume (mf) with a restrained character. (The metallic character is often difficult to hear in classical singing as it is disguised by a darker sound colour). Men can use Curbing in classical singing in their entire range, when a medium loud volume and a restrained character is wanted. Women use Curbing in classical singing in the middle part, and in the lower part of the voice, when a medium loud volume and a restrained character are wanted.</p>
                    <p>Curbing is used in everyday life when you are wailing, moaning or whining.</p>

                <h2>Curbing</h2>

                    <h3>Definition for Overdrive (foundation level)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overdrive can range from reduced to full metallic, containing all possible amounts of metal, from a minimal amount, like 1%, all the way to 100% (full) metal</li>
                        <li>The metal has a clear, open and shouty character.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The character of Overdrive is clear, often direct, unrestrained, and ‘shouty’, like when you call ‘hey’ after someone in the street. Overdrive is a mode with a non-breathy sound. When starting out, Overdrive can be found by establishing a ‘bite’.</p>
                    <p>I have chosen the name Overdrive because I find it descriptive of the direct, clear, open and loud sound you can obtain in this mode. My inspiration for the name is from the overdrive that can be found in guitar pedals and from the fifth gear in sports cars (i.e. overdrive gear).</p>
                    <p>You cannot add audible air to the voice in Overdrive; even attempting it may result in straining the voice.</p>
                    <p>In terms of pitch, Overdrive is the most limited mode. It is especially limited for women. The upper limit for women is D5 and for men C5. There is no lower limit.</p>
                    <p>In Overdrive, you can only use the vowels ‘EH’ (as in ‘stay’) and ‘OH’ (as in ‘so’).</p>

                    <p>Female — Overdrive</p>
                        <audio controls autoplay="true" src="https://completevocalinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/soundlibrary/CVT%20F%20097.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>

                    <p>The volume in Overdrive is medium loud to very loud, from volume 4 -10 out of 10. In the beginning the higher the note, the louder and more distinct the shouting character becomes, and the more distinct the difference in volume and character from Neutral and Curbing. When you have obtained a greater control over Overdrive, you can use it in medium volume where the character becomes less Overdrive-y/shouty.</p>
                    <p>The sound colour can be altered quite a bit in Overdrive.</p>
                    <p>Overdrive is the most commonly used mode for men and women in the low part of the voice and when speaking or singing loudly.</p>
                    <p>Overdrive is used in almost all styles, when singing in a low pitch, or when the volume is medium to loud and when a degree of clear metal is desired, for example in rock music.</p>
                    <p>Overdrive is used in classical music when singing medium loud to loud (mf-ff) with a clear character (the obvious metallic character is often difficult to hear as it is disguised by a darker sound colour). Men can use Overdrive in classical singing in their entire range. (Observing the pitch limit of C5). Women are mostly using Overdrive in classical singing in the lower part of the middle part and in the low part of the voice when singing medium to loud (mf-ff), for example like Maria Callas.</p>
                    <p>Overdrive is used in everyday life when you speak and sing in medium to loud volume, and loud Overdrive is used in everyday life when you talk loudly and when you are shouting.</p>

                <h2>Edge</h2>

                    <h3>Definition for Edge (foundation level)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Edge can range from reduced to full metallic, containing all possible amounts of metal, from a minimal amount, like 1%, all the way to 100% (full) metal</li>
                        <li>Distinct twang of the epiglottic funnel</li>
                        <li>The metal has a clear, open and sharp character</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The character of Edge is clear, open and could be described as direct and unrestrained, yet lighter and sharper than Overdrive. Edge has a non-breathy character. Edge can be found by maintaining a clear and open character and adding the distinct twang of the epiglottic funnel (as if imitating a duck).</p>
                    <p>You cannot add audible air to the voice in Edge; even attempting it may result in straining the voice.</p>
                    <p>I have chosen the name Edge because I find it descriptive of the bright, clear and sharp sound you can obtain in this mode.</p>
                    <p>Men can use Edge in all pitches. Women can use Edge through all the various parts of the voice up to the High C. Women cannot sing in Edge in the very high part of the voice. There is no lower limit.</p>
                    <p>Only twanged vowels can be used in Edge, as distinct twang and a clear character are conditions for the mode. Accordingly, you must use only ‘I’ (as in sit), ‘EH’ (as in ‘stay’), ‘A’ (as in ‘and’), and ‘OE’ (as in ‘herb’).</p>

                    <p>Female — Edge</p>
                        <audio controls autoplay="true" src="https://completevocalinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/soundlibrary/CVT%20F%20120.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>

                    <p>The volume in Edge is medium loud to very loud, from volume 4 -10 out of 10. In the beginning the higher the notes, the louder and more distinct the sharp character becomes, and the more distinct the difference in volume and character from Neutral and Curbing is. When you have obtained greater control over Edge, you can use it in medium volume, where the character becomes less Edgy/sharp.</p>
                    <p>The sound colour in Edge can be altered less than in the other modes, especially in the high part of the voice.</p>
                    <p>Edge is used in almost all styles, when the volume is medium to loud and there is a degree of clear metal in the notes. Examples include heavy rock, gospel, R&B and pop music.</p>
                    <p>Edge is used in classical music when singing medium loud to loud (mf-ff) with a clear, open character (the obvious metallic character is often difficult to hear as it is disguised by a darker sound colour). Men can use Edge in classical singing in their entire range, and the Edge is often clearly heard in the high part of the voice, such as the High C of a tenor. Women are mostly using Edge in classical singing in the middle and low part of the voice when singing medium to loud (mf-ff)</p>
                    <p>Edge is used in everyday life when you speak and sing in medium to loud volume, and loud Edge is used in everyday life when you scream.</p>
